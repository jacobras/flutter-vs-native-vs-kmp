# Flutter versus Native versus KMP: a Performance Comparison

Comparing the performance of the same app in Flutter, native and Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) on Android and iOS.

## üêà Sample app

The app will contain a single screen, load cat pictures from a public API and show them in a horizontal list.
Each picture can be clicked to show it zoomed in below the list.

### üì¶ Builds

Release builds are available in `/builds`.

## üìä Benchmark results

### üì¶ App size

Android sizes were measured by running Bundletool* on the signed, minified release bundles to create an APK set for a
Pixel 4a, and then running `get-size` on that APK set. iOS sizes were measured running the App Thinning Size report.

| Technology                   | Android  | iOS     | Remarks                                                      |
|------------------------------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Native** (Compose/SwiftUI) | 1.463 MB | 1.7 MB  |                                                              |
| **KMP** (Compose)            | 1.463 MB | 24.8 MB | Includes Skia on iOS, where Android relies on built-in Skia. |
| **Flutter**                  | 6.828 MB | 48.1 MB | Also includes Skia on iOS + Flutter framework.               |

Note: due to https://github.com/Kamel-Media/Kamel/issues/47 the Kamel library isn't being minified. Once that's fixed,
the Android native and Android KMP builds will both be smaller.

*commands used:

* `bundletool build-apks --connected-device --bundle=release.aab --output=release.apks`
* `bundletool get-size total --apks=release.apks`

### üöÄ Startup

Android startup benchmarks were executed
using [Macrobenchmark](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/benchmarking/macrobenchmark-overview), 5 times on
a Pixel 4a. Test suite was run twice
in alternating order. I couldn't get iOS benchmarks to run. They ran, but didn't collect any reports.
